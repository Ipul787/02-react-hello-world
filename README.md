This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Answer of Question no. 2

1. Explanation of things

TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and it adds static typing to the language. This allows developers to catch errors early in development process. 

ESLint: ESLint is a static code analysis tool to identify problematic patterns in JavaScript code. It helps enforce a particular coding style and best practices on a project, ensuring consistency and minimizing bugs. 

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a CSS framework that provide slow-level utility classes to rapidly build custom designs. This approach offers more flexibility and allows for rapid deployment without writing another CSS file. 

App Router: App Router refers to a collection of routers or module used in web development frameworks to handle routing in web application. 

Import alias: Import alias is a feature in modern JS and TypeScript that allows developeers to define alternative names for modules or paths when importing them into a file.

next-env.d.ts: This is used in Next.js projects and contains TypeScript declarations for the runtime environment. 

package.json: This file contains metadata for the project and its dependencies and also includes scripts for running development server, project build, and running tests. 

package-lock.json: This file locks the versions of the project dependencies to ensure consistent builds. 

postcss.config.js: This is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins that allows the developer to specify PostCSS plugins. 

README.md: This file contains information about the project.
